Repository for converting my website written in PHP/JavaScript to NodeJS/NextJS.
- There are still some CSS bugs

#### Requirements to run:
  - Initialize project NextJS with TypeScript
  - npm install sass
  - npm install serverless-mysql
  - set environment variables for database connection

### Livebuild only avialable if server is running and this address is correctly updated
  - Link: http://91.113.57.87:3000/
  - Server hosted on Raspberry Pi (slow build times)
