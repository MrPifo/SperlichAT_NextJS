Repository for converting my website written in PHP/JavaScript to NodeJS/NextJS.
- There are still some CSS bugs

Link to current livebuild (only works if server started): http://91.113.57.87:3000/
* Notice: Build can be slow due to being hosted on a raspberry pi

Requirements to run:
  - Initialize project NextJS with TypeScript
  - npm install sass
  - npm install serverless-mysql
  - set environment variables for database connection
